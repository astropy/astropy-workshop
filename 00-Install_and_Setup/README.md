# Getting Started with Python and Anaconda

Please come to the workshop with a laptop already configured as described below.
If you have any problems with any of these steps, please check if your problem has
already been reported at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/issues/). If not,
[ask your question in the issue tracker](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=workshop-question&template=question-from-workshop-participant.md&title=%5BQuestion%5D+Summarize+your+question+here).

## 1. Clone This Repository

Download the workshop folder using
[git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/):

    % git clone https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop.git

If you don't have git installed, you can download the ZIP file by pressing the
green *Clone or download* button at
https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop and selecting *Download ZIP*.
However, this option is not recommended because it impedes the ability to
update your copy of the repository if updates are made.

## 2. Install Miniconda (if needed)

*Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap
version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend
on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few
others. Note, though, that if you have either Miniconda or the full Anaconda
already installed, you can skip to the next step.*

Check if Miniconda is already installed.

    % conda info

If Miniconda is not already installed, follow these instructions for your
operating system: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

On Windows, you might also need
[additional compilers](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/wiki/Windows-Compilers).

## 3. Create a conda environment for the workshop

*Miniconda includes an environment manager called conda. Environments
allow you to have multiple sets of Python packages installed at the same
time, making reproducibility and upgrades easier. You can create,
export, list, remove, and update environments that have different versions of
Python and/or packages installed in them.*

[Create a conda environment for this workshop using a yml file](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).
The python version and all needed packages, including astropy, are listed in the
[environment.yml](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/master/00-Install_and_Setup/environment.yml) file.

On Mac or Linux, open your terminal and verify your shell environment:

    % echo $SHELL

If the output text does not contain `bash`, switch to the bash shell before
being able to run anything related to conda.

On Windows, open the `Anaconda Prompt` terminal app.

Now navigate to this directory in the terminal. For example, if you installed
the astropy-workshop directory in your home directory, you could type the
following.

On a Mac/Linux:

    % cd astropy-workshop/00-Install_and_Setup/

On Windows:

    % cd astropy-workshop\00-Install_and_Setup\

And finally, on any platform, to install and activate the astropy-workshop
environment, type:

    % conda env create -n astropy-workshop --file environment.yml
    % conda activate astropy-workshop

## 4. Check Installation

The name of the new conda environment created above should be displayed next
to the terminal prompt: `(astropy-workshop) %`

Run the `check_env.py` script to check the Python environment and some of the
required dependencies:

    (astropy-workshop) % python check_env.py

If the script reports that some of the versions do not match, check first
whether the package was installed using conda or pip, then update accordingly.
The example below a fake package called `packagename`; replace it with the
actual package that you need to update.

    (astropy-workshop) % conda list packagename

If it was installed with conda, you will see (the channel column might or
might not be populated):

    # packages in environment at .../miniconda/envs/astropy-workshop:
    #
    # Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
    packagename               X.Y.Z         py37hf484d3e_1000

Otherwise, if it was installed with pip, you will see the channel stating the
name `pypi`:

    # packages in environment at .../miniconda/envs/astropy-workshop:
    #
    # Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
    packagename               X.Y.Z                     pypi_0    pypi

To update the reported package with conda:

    (astropy-workshop) % conda update packagename

Otherwise, to update with pip:

    (astropy-workshop) % pip install packagename --upgrade
