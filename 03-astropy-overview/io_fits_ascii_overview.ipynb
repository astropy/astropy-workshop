    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "What just happened?! It certainly appeared as if the mask HDU had been loaded since we could access its header, but the data clearly was not loaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error message, `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`, provides a clue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is primarily historical. FITS files are, by default, opened in *memory map* mode to avoid reading in the entire file at once. In memory map mode, the `.data` that looks like an array is actually, because of the way numpy handles memory maps, a reference to the file with the data. That has been the default in astropy since its very beginning, including in the stand-alone `pyfits` package that preceded, and then became a part of, astropy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a context manager is supposed to guarantee that any resources created in the context, like opening a file handle, is cleaned up, i.e. removed, when you exit the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "That has led to a compromise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If no reference is made to the data in the with block, e.g., by assigning the data to a variable, and the file is opened with `memmap=True`, the default, then all file handles are closed when you exit the block and you have no access to the data after exiting the block. You do have access to the header because that is always read from disk. This is the case we saw above.\n",
    "2. If there is a reference to the data in the `with` block, and the file is opened with `memmap=True`, the default, then a reference to the file is maintained by `numpy`, which handles the memory map for astropy. That gives you access to the memory-mapped data at the expense of maintaining a hidden file reference. An example of this is below. \n",
    "3. If `memmap=False` the situation is less confusing because the header and data are read in as needed. However, the data is not read in unless it is accessed inside the with block. The downside is that more memory is used, which can be an issue for large images. An example of this is below.\n"
