# Getting Started with Python and Anaconda

Please come to the workshop with a laptop already configured as described below.
If you have any problems with any of these steps, please [open an issue](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/issues).

## 1. Clone This Repository

Download the workshop folder using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/):

    % git clone https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop.git

If you don't have git installed, you can download the ZIP file by pressing the green *Clone or download* button at https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop and selecting *Download ZIP*.  However, this option is less prefered because it makes it more difficult for you to update your copy of the repository if updates are made.

## 2. Install Anaconda (if needed)

*Anaconda includes conda, conda build, Python and 100+ automatically installed, open source scientific packages and their dependencies that have been tested to work well together, including SciPy, NumPy and many others.*

Check if Anaconda is already installed.
    
    % conda info

If Anaconda is not already installed, follow the Anaconda instructions for your operating system: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
   
Choose between installing the full Anaconda (3 GB) or  Miniconda (400 MB).
Miniconda comes with fewer default packages so it's faster to download and takes up less drive space. 

## 3. Create a conda environment for the workshop
*Anaconda includes an environment manager called conda.  You can create, export, list, remove and update environments that have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them.* 

[Create a conda environment for this workshop using a yml file](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). 
The python version and all needed packages, including astropy, are listed in the [environment.yml](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/master/00-Install_and_Setup/environment.yml) file

On mac or linux, open your terminal and verify your shell environment: 

    % echo $SHELL 
    
If the output text does not contain `bash` then switch to the bash shell before being able to run anything related to Anaconda.

On windows, just open the `Anaconda Prompt` terminal app.

Now navigate to this directory in the terminal.  For example, if you installed the astropy-workshop directory in your home directory, you could type:

On a mac/linux:

    % cd astropy-workshop/00-Install_and_Setup/  

In windows:

    % cd astropy-workshop\00-Install_and_Setup\

And finally, on any platform, to install and activate the astropy-workshop environment, type:

    % conda env create -n astropy-workshop --file environment.yml
    % conda activate astropy-workshop

## 4. Check Installation

The name of the new conda environment created above should be displayed next to the terminal prompt: `(astropy-workshop) % `

Run the check_env.py script to check the Python environment and some of the required dependencies:

    (astropy-workshop) % python check_env.py

If the script reports that some of the versions don't match, update the reported packages using the ``conda update``, namely:

    (astropy-workshop) % conda update <packagename>
