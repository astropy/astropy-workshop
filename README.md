# Astropy Learning at Observatories of HAwaii (ALOHA)

*Workshops at Subaru and Keck*


## PRE-WORKSHOP TO-DOs

### Install Python if you do not have it

Please be sure your laptop is properly configured before the workshop by following the
[installation and setup instructions](00-Install_and_Setup).

*Warning*: Installation and setup could take as long as *one hour* depending on your current configuration and internet speeds.
DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE DAY OF THE WORKSHOP.

### Review some introductory Python if you have not used Python

That material is in the folder `02-PythonIntro`. A link to that -- so that you can read it even if you have not used Python before -- is [here](https://github.com/mwcraig/astropy-workshop/tree/ALOHA-2024/02-PythonIntro). Click on the individual notebooks, whose names end `.ipynb`, to open them.

Doing this before the workshop will put you in a better position to follow along with the workshop materials.

## Schedules

At both sets of workshops there will be science use cases integrated into
the presentation topics.

Note that the materials are very similar between the two workshops, although the emphasis on the Subaru and Keck days are slightly different.

## Description

The goal of the workshops is threefold:

+ Increase the adoption of Astropy (both core astropy and Astropy Affiliated packages) in the workflow of Hawaii Island Observatories.
+ Encourage participation of observatory scientists and developers in the development of astropy and Astropy Affiliated packages.
+ Identify priority areas for Astropy development to facilitate adoption of astropy and Astropy Affiliated packages.
