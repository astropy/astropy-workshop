Dear Astropy Workshop Participants,

We are looking forward to seeing you at the Python and Astropy for Astronomical Data Analysis Workshop on January 4, 2026 at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Phoenix.

The astropy workshop will assume some familiarity with Python. If you’re new to Python, we’ve listed a few introductory Python resources that you could choose to review before the workshop:
* https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/tree/aas237-2021/02-PythonIntro (Introductory notebooks from a previous AAS workshop)
* https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/ 
* https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/
* https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3 

[Setup Instructions](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup/README.md)

Please be sure your laptop is properly configured BEFORE the workshop. The setup could take as long as one hour depending on your current configuration and internet speed. If you have any trouble, please open a new issue in the astropy-workshop repo using the “Question from workshop participant” option,  or post a message on the #workshop Slack channel in the Astropy workspace (described below). If on the morning of the workshop, you still have doubts or questions about your laptop setup, please arrive promptly at 9am.

Our facilitators will be making small adjustments to the content of the workshop notebooks. We will send one more email just before the workshop with instructions to update to the final version of the notebooks.

[Schedule](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop#schedule)

We've got a full day! 9:00am - 5:30pm in Room 131 C at the Phoenix Convention Center.

This workshop is not yet sold out, and we are anticipating folks to walk in, who did not pre-register for the workshop. If you do not arrive by 10:00, your seat may be given away to a walk-in participant. If you know you're going to be late, please drop me an email (bmmorris@stsci.edu).

Coffee will be available in the morning and afternoon. Lunch will NOT be provided.
