Dear Astropy Workshop Participants,

We are looking forward to seeing you at the _Using Python and Astropy for Astronomical Data Analysis Workshop_
on January 7, 2024 at the American Astronomical Society meeting!

__Setup Instructions__
https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup

Please be sure your laptop is properly configured BEFORE the workshop. The setup could take as long as one hour depending on your current configuration and internet speeds. If you have any trouble, please open an issue in the repo using https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop#problems-or-questions or post a message on the #workshop Slack channel in the Astropy workspace (described below). If on the morning of the workshop, you still have doubts or questions about your laptop setup, please arrive promptly at 9am.

Our facilitators will be making small adjustments to the content of the workshop notebooks. We will send one more email just before the workshop with instructions to update to the final version of the notebooks.
